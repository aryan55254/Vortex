## Vortex

Vortex is a full-stack web application designed to be a personal, high-speed video clipping utility. It allows users to paste a link from major platforms (YouTube, X, Instagram, etc.) to either download the full video or precisely trim a specific segment. The backend leverages yt-dlp for data fetching and ffmpeg for efficient, server-side processing, all powered by a robust architecture using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, with MongoDB as the database.
